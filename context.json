    "abstract": "We present a new generalization of the extensible bin packing with unequal bin sizes problem. In this generalization the cost of exceeding the bin size depends on the index of the bin and not only on the amount in which the size of the bin is exceeded. This type of problem can be studied both as a scheduling problem (the number of bins is fixed) and as a bin packing problem (the number of bins is chosen by the algorithm). We will discuss the approximability of the (offline) generalized problem both in terms of the bin packing variant where an AFPTAS could be designed and of the scheduling variant where an EPTAS is exhibited. This last EPTAS is based on using the shifting technique followed by a solution of polynomial number of n-fold programming instances."

In this talk, we discuss some recent results and major open problems related to 2-D geometric bin packing, vector packing, strip packing, 2-D geometric knapsack, and weighted bipartite edge coloring."

    "abstract": "We discuss problems and methods for packing a set of objects into a given container, in particular a set of different-size circles or squares into a square or circular container. Questions of this type have attracted a considerable amount of attention and are known to be notoriously hard. We focus on a particularly simple criterion for deciding whether a set can be packed: comparing the total area A of all objects to the area C of the container. The critical packing density δ* is the largest value A/C for which any set of area A can be packed into a container of area C. We describe algorithms that establish the critical density of squares in a square (δ* = 0.5), of circles in a square (δ* = 0.5390…), circles in a circle (δ* = 0.5), and squares in a circle (δ* = 0.509). We also provide a complete characterization of the critical covering density of rectangles by disks."

    "abstract": "In this talk we present an overview about new results for bin packing and related scheduling problems. During the last years we have worked on the design of eﬃcient exact and approximation algorithms for packing and scheduling problems. In order to obtain faster algorithms we studied integer linear programming (ILP) formulations for these problems and proved structural results for optimum solutions of the corresponding ILPs."

    "abstract": "We consider the bin packing problem (BP) from the practical view. BP is know to be (strongly) NP-hard. Despite this fact, we find that certain input classes can be solved quite easily. More exactly we try to solve the Falkenauer U and the Schwerin benchmark instances. These commonly used benchmark classes have the property that the bin size is a given integer, the item sizes are drawn randomly by uniform distribution from some interval (and then rounded to integers). For the Schwerin class we are able to solve all 200 instances optimally in a greedy way. In case of the Falkenauer U class the problem is harder, here we can get optimal solution with some (other) greedy type algorithm, in about 90% of the instances. The conclusion is, that such algorithms can be considered as pre-solve methods, they solve most of the cases, and only the remained instances should be solved by some more sophisticated algorithm."
